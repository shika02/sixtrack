This projects attempts to reorganize the input/output data management by building a SixDesk compatible python library using SQLite user files and a centralized MySQL server so as to reduce the small intermediate files being created in the whole process and create a central database for easy synchronization between user (local machine or cern cluster) and server (Boinc server)

It is still in prototype mode
